# Pomodoro Timer Desktop App

A simple, customizable Pomodoro Timer built using [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and originally based on the [electron-quick-start](https://github.com/electron/electron-quick-start) template.

This application helps you stay productive by guiding you through focused work sessions followed by short breaks. You can dynamically adjust session and break durations, and youâ€™ll receive notifications when each session ends.

## Features

- **Focus & Break Sessions**: Alternate between focused work periods and short breaks.
- **Customizable Durations**: Adjust focus and break times via the UI at any point.
- **Automatic Cycling**: After the timer finishes one session, it automatically transitions to the next.
- **Desktop Notifications**: Get notified when a session ends, ensuring you know when to take a break or get back to work.
- **Modern UI**: A dark-themed, minimalist interface for a distraction-free experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js & npm**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).
- **Git**: (Optional) for cloning the repository.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Gorvok/pomodoro-timer-electron.git
    cd pomodoro-timer-electron
    ```

   Or simply download the repository as a ZIP and extract it.

2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

A window will launch with the Pomodoro timer interface.

## Usage

1. **Start a Session**:
   - Click **Start** to begin your focus period (default: 25 minutes).

2. **Stop the Timer**:
   - Click **Stop** to pause the current session. Click **Start** again to resume.

3. **Reset the Timer**:
   - Click **Reset** to return to the initial focus session time.

4. **Adjusting Durations**:
   - Change the Focus Session, Short Break, or Long Break times via the input fields.
   - The new durations apply immediately if the timer is stopped or at the start of the next session.

5. **Notifications**:
   - At the end of a session, a desktop notification alerts you to switch tasks.
   - Grant notification permissions when prompted.

## Customization

- **Theme & UI**: Modify `styles.css` to change colors, fonts, or layout.
- **Timer Logic**: Most logic is in `renderer.js`. You can tweak session lengths or add features like long breaks after several work sessions.
- **Main Process**: The `main.js` file manages the Electron lifecycle. Adjust if you need to customize window behavior.
